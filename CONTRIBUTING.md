### Usage Questions

Please ask usage questions on
[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/authlogic).

## Development

Most local development should be done using the oldest supported version of
ruby. See `required_ruby_version` in the gemspec.

### Testing

Tests can be run against different versions of Rails:

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails_6.0.rb bundle install
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails_6.0.rb bundle exec rake
```

To run a single test:

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails_6.0.rb \
  bundle exec ruby -I test path/to/test.rb
```

Bundler can be omitted, and the latest installed version of a gem dependency
will be used. This is only suitable for certain unit tests.

```
ruby â€“I test path/to/test.rb
```

### Test MySQL

```
mysql -e 'drop database authlogic; create database authlogic;' && \
  DB=mysql BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails_5.2.rb bundle exec rake
```

### Test PostgreSQL

```
psql -c 'create database authlogic;' -U postgres
DB=postgres BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails_6.0.rb bundle exec rake
```

### Linting

Running `rake` also runs a linter, rubocop. Contributions must pass both
the linter and the tests. The linter can be run on its own.

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails_6.0.rb bundle exec rubocop
```

To run the tests without linting, use `rake test`.

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails_6.0.rb bundle exec rake test
```

### Version Control Branches

We've been trying to follow the rails way, stable branches, but have been
inconsistent. We should have one branche for each minor version, named like
`4-3-stable`. Releases should be done on those branches, not in master. So,
the "stable" branches should be the only branches with release tags.

### A normal release (no backport)

1. git checkout 4-3-stable # the latest "stable" branch (see above)
1. git merge master
1. Update version number in lib/authlogic/version.rb
1. In the changelog,
  - Add release date to entry
  - Add a new "Unreleased" section at top
1. In the readme,
  - Update version number in the docs table at the top
  - For non-patch versions, update the compatibility table
1. Commit with message like "Release 4.3.0"
1. git push origin 4-3-stable
1. CI should pass
1. gem build authlogic.gemspec
1. gem push authlogic-4.3.0.gem
1. git tag -a -m "v4.3.0" "v4.3.0"
1. git push --tags origin 4-3-stable
1. update the docs in the master branch, because that's what people look at
  - git checkout master
  - git cherry-pick abcd1234 # the SHA from the stable branch
  - commit and push with `[ci skip]`
