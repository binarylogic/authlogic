# Rails support in Authlogic 5

2018-12-03

Authlogic 5 adds support for rails 6.0, and drops support for rails < 5.2.
This is in keeping with the [Maintenance Policy
for Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/maintenance_policy.html).
When rails 6 is released, rails < 5.2 will be EoL. Authlogic 5 reflects this.

Authlogic 4 will continue to support rails `>= 4.2, < 5.3`. We'll continue to
accept contributions to Authlogic 4 for as long as is practical.

In conclusion, Authlogic 4 supports the "rails 5 era" and Authlogic 5 supports
the "rails 6 era".
