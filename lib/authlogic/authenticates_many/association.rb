module Authlogic
  module AuthenticatesMany
    # An object of this class is used as a proxy for the authenticates_many relationship. It basically allows you to "save" scope details
    # and call them on an object, which allows you to do the following:
    #
    #   @account.user_sessions.new
    #   @account.user_sessions.find
    #   # ... etc
    #
    # You can call all of the class level methods off of an object with a saved scope, so that calling the above methods scopes the user
    # sessions down to that specific account. To implement this via ActiveRecord do something like:
    #
    #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     authenticates_many :user_sessions
    #   end
