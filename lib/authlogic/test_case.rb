module Authlogic
  # This module is a collection of methods and classes that help you easily test Authlogic. In fact,
  # I use these same tools to test the internals of Authlogic.
  #
  # === The quick and dirty
  #
  #   require "authlogic/test_case" # include at the top of test_helper.rb
  #   setup :activate_authlogic # run before tests are executed
  #   UserSession.create(users(:whomever)) # logs a user in
  #
  # For a more detailed explanation, see below.
  #
  # === Setting up
  #
  # Authlogic comes with some simple testing tools. To get these, you need to first require Authlogic's TestCase. If
  # you are doing this in a rails app, you would require this file at the top of your test_helper.rb file:
  #
  #   require "authlogic/test_case"
  #
  # If you are using Test::Unit::TestCase, the standard testing library that comes with ruby, then you can skip this next part.
  # If you are not, you need to include the Authlogic::TestCase into your testing suite as follows:
  #
  #   include Authlogic::TestCase
  #
  # Now that everything is ready to go, let's move onto actually testing. Here is the basic idea behind testing:
  #
  # Authlogic requires a "connection" to your controller to activate it. In the same manner that ActiveRecord requires a connection to
  # your database. It can't do anything until it gets connected. That being said, Authlogic will raise an
  # Authlogic::Session::Activation::NotActivatedError any time you try to instantiate an object without a "connection".
  # So before you do anything with Authlogic, you need to activate / connect Authlogic. Let's walk through how to do this in tests:
  #
  # === Fixtures / Factories
  #
  # Creating users via fixtures / factories is easy. Here's an example of a fixture:
  #
  #   ben:
  #     email: whatever@whatever.com
  #     password_salt: <%= salt = Authlogic::Random.hex_token %>
  #     crypted_password: <%= Authlogic::CryptoProviders::Sha512.encrypt("benrocks" + salt) %>
  #     persistence_token: <%= Authlogic::Random.hex_token %>
  #     single_access_token: <%= Authlogic::Random.friendly_token %>
  #     perishable_token: <%= Authlogic::Random.friendly_token %>
  #
  # Notice the crypted_password value. Just supplement that with whatever crypto provider you are using, if you are not using the default.
  #
  # === Functional tests
  #
  # Activating Authlogic isn't a problem here, because making a request will activate Authlogic for you. The problem is
  # logging users in so they can access restricted areas. Solving this is simple, just do this:
  #
  #   setup :activate_authlogic
  #
  # For those of you unfamiliar with TestUnit, the setup method basically just executes a method before any test is ran.
  # It is essentially "setting up" your tests.
  #
  # Once you have done this, just log users in like usual:
  #
  #   UserSession.create(users(:whomever))
  #   # access my restricted area here
  #
  # Do this before you make your request and it will act as if that user is logged in.
  #
  # === Integration tests
  #
  # Again, just like functional tests, you don't have to do anything. As soon as you make a request, Authlogic will be
  # connected. If you want to activate Authlogic before making a request follow the same steps described in the
  # "functional tests" section above. It works in the same manner.
  #
  # === Unit tests
  #
  # The only time you need to do any trickiness here is if you want to test Authlogic models. Maybe you added some custom
  # code or methods in your Authlogic models. Maybe you are writing a plugin or a library that extends Authlogic.
  #
  # That being said, in this environment there is no controller. So you need to use a "mock" controller. Something
  # that looks like a controller, acts like a controller, but isn't a "real" controller. You are essentially connecting
  # Authlogic to your "mock" controller, then you can test off of the mock controller to make sure everything is functioning
  # properly.
  #
  # I use a mock controller to test Authlogic myself. It's part of the Authlogic library that you can easily use. It's as simple
  # as functional and integration tests. Just do the following:
  #
  #   setup :activate_authlogic
  #
  # You also get a controller method that you can test off of. For example:
  #
  #   ben = users(:ben)
  #   assert_nil controller.session["user_credentials"]
  #   assert UserSession.create(ben)
  #   assert_equal controller.session["user_credentials"], ben.persistence_token
  #
  # See how I am checking that Authlogic is interacting with the controller properly? That's the idea here.
  module TestCase
    # Activates authlogic so that you can use it in your tests. You should call this method in your test's setup. Ex:
    #
    #   setup :activate_authlogic
    def activate_authlogic
      if @request && !@request.respond_to?(:params)
        class <<@request
          alias_method :params, :parameters
        end
      end

      Authlogic::Session::Base.controller = (@request && Authlogic::TestCase::RailsRequestAdapter.new(@request)) || controller
    end

    # The Authlogic::TestCase::MockController object passed to Authlogic to activate it. You can access this in your test.
    # See the module description for an example.
    def controller
      @controller ||= Authlogic::TestCase::MockController.new
    end
  end

  ::Test::Unit::TestCase.send(:include, TestCase) if defined?(::Test::Unit::TestCase)
  ::MiniTest::Unit::TestCase.send(:include, TestCase) if defined?(::MiniTest::Unit::TestCase)
  ::MiniTest::Test.send(:include, TestCase) if defined?(::MiniTest::Test)
end
