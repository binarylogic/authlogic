module Authlogic
  module Session
    # This module is responsible for authenticating the user via params, which ultimately allows the user to log in using a URL like the following:
    #
    #   https://www.domain.com?user_credentials=4LiXF7FiGUppIPubBPey
    #
    # Notice the token in the URL, this is a single access token. A single access token is used for single access only, it is not persisted. Meaning the user
    # provides it, Authlogic grants them access, and that's it. If they want access again they need to provide the token again. Authlogic will
    # *NEVER* try to persist the session after authenticating through this method.
    #
    # For added security, this token is *ONLY* allowed for RSS and ATOM requests. You can change this with the configuration. You can also define if
    # it is allowed dynamically by defining a single_access_allowed? method in your controller. For example:
    #
    #   class UsersController < ApplicationController
    #     private
    #       def single_access_allowed?
    #         action_name == "index"
    #       end
    #
    # Also, by default, this token is permanent. Meaning if the user changes their password, this token will remain the same. It will only change
    # when it is explicitly reset.
    #
    # You can modify all of this behavior with the Config sub module.

        #
        # You can change the "user_credentials" key above with this configuration option. Keep in mind, just like cookie_key, if you supply an id
        # the id will be appended to the front. Check out cookie_key for more details. Also checkout the "Single Access / Private Feeds Access" section in the README.
