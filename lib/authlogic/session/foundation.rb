        #   session.credentials = [my_user_object, true]

        # and if you need to set an id, just pass it last. This value need be the last item in the array you pass, since the id is something that
        # you control yourself, it should never be set from a hash or a form. Examples:
        #
        #   session.credentials = [{:login => "my login", :password => "my password", :remember_me => true}, :my_id]
        #   session.credentials = [my_user_object, true, :my_id]
