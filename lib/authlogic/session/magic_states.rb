module Authlogic
  module Session
    # Authlogic tries to check the state of the record before creating the session. If
    # your record responds to the following methods and any of them return false,
    # validation will fail:
    #
    #   Method name           Description
    #   active?               Is the record marked as active?
    #   approved?             Has the record been approved?
    #   confirmed?            Has the record been confirmed?
    #
    # Authlogic does nothing to define these methods for you, its up to you to define what
    # they mean. If your object responds to these methods Authlogic will use them,
    # otherwise they are ignored.
    #
    # What's neat about this is that these are checked upon any type of login. When
    # logging in explicitly, by cookie, session, or basic http auth. So if you mark a user
    # inactive in the middle of their session they wont be logged back in next time they
    # refresh the page. Giving you complete control.
    #
    # Need Authlogic to check your own "state"? No problem, check out the hooks section
    # below. Add in a before_validation to do your own checking. The sky is the limit.
