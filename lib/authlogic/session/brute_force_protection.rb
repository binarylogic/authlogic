  module Session
    # A brute force attacks is executed by hammering a login with as many password
    # combinations as possible, until one works. A brute force attacked is generally
    # combated with a slow hashing algorithm such as BCrypt. You can increase the cost,
    # which makes the hash generation slower, and ultimately increases the time it takes
    # to execute a brute force attack. Just to put this into perspective, if a hacker was
    # to gain access to your server and execute a brute force attack locally, meaning
    # there is no network lag, it would probably take decades to complete. Now throw in
    # network lag and it would take MUCH longer.
    #
    # But for those that are extra paranoid and can't get enough protection, why not stop
    # them as soon as you realize something isn't right? That's what this module is all
    # about. By default the consecutive_failed_logins_limit configuration option is set to
    # 50, if someone consecutively fails to login after 50 attempts their account will be
    # suspended. This is a very liberal number and at this point it should be obvious that
    # something is not right. If you wish to lower this number just set the configuration
    # to a lower number:
    #
    #   class UserSession < Authlogic::Session::Base
    #     consecutive_failed_logins_limit 10
    #   end
