      # A good example when this might be needed is when you want to have a normal user session and a "secure" user session.
      # The secure user session would be created only when they want to modify their billing information, or other sensitive
      # information. Similar to me.com. This requires 2 user sessions. Just use an id for the "secure" session and you should be good.
      #
      # You can set the id during initialization (see initialize for more information), or as an attribute:
      #
      #   session.id = :my_id
      #
      # Just be sure and set your id before you save your session.
      #
      # Lastly, to retrieve your session with the id check out the find class method.
