module Authlogic
  module Session
    # Allows you to create session with an object. Ex:
    #
    #   UserSession.create(my_user_object)
    #
    # Be careful with this, because Authlogic is assuming that you have already confirmed that the
    # user is who he says he is.
    #
    # For example, this is the method used to persist the session internally. Authlogic finds the user with
    # the persistence token. At this point we know the user is who he says he is, so Authlogic just creates a
    # session with the record. This is particularly useful for 3rd party authentication methods, such as
    # OpenID. Let that method verify the identity, once it's verified, pass the object and create a session.
