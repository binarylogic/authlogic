    # The family of adaptive hash functions (BCrypt, SCrypt, PBKDF2)
    # is the best choice for password storage today. They have the
    # three properties of password hashing that are desirable. They
    # are one-way, unique, and slow. While a salted SHA or MD5 hash is
    # one-way and unique, preventing rainbow table attacks, they are
    # still lightning fast and attacks on the stored passwords are
    # much more effective. This benchmark demonstrates the effective
    # slowdown that BCrypt provides:
