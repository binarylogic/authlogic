    # For most apps Sha512 is plenty secure, but if you are building an app that stores nuclear launch codes you might want to consier BCrypt. This is an extremely
    # secure hashing algorithm, mainly because it is slow. A brute force attack on a BCrypt encrypted password would take much longer than a brute force attack on a
    # password encrypted with a Sha algorithm. Keep in mind you are sacrificing performance by using this, generating a password takes exponentially longer than any
    # of the Sha algorithms. I did some benchmarking to save you some time with your decision:

    #   require "bcrypt"
    #   require "digest"
    #   require "benchmark"
    #
    #   Benchmark.bm(18) do |x|

    #     x.report("BCrypt (cost = 2:") { 100.times { BCrypt::Password.create("mypass", :cost => 2) } }
    #     x.report("Sha512:") { 100.times { Digest::SHA512.hexdigest("mypass") } }
    #     x.report("Sha1:") { 100.times { Digest::SHA1.hexdigest("mypass") } }
    #   end
